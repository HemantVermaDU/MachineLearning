1. Using SVM, perform classification on Iris Datset.
2. Using stochastic gradient descent in neural networks,
predict the values of house prices using Boston dataset.
3. Based on multiple features/variables perform Linear Regression.
For example, based on a number of additional features like number of bedrooms,
servant room, number of balconies, number of houses of years a house has been
built â€“ predict the price of a house. You may use the Boston dataset or any
other dataset of your choice.
4. Implement a classification/ logistic regression problem for checking
whether an email is spam or not.
5. Write a python program to implement linear regression and logistic regression
using gradient descent algorithm. Remember the different cost functions.
6. Perform linear regression on any dataset (say Boston house prices).
Apply Ridge regularization on the same and compare the performance before and
after applying L2 regularization.
7. Perform logistic regression for classification on iris dataset. Apply ridge
regularization and compare the performance before and after regularization.
8. Perform linear regression on any dataset (say Boston house prices). Apply Lasso
regularization on the same and compare the performance before and after applying
L1 regularization. Also compare the results with Ridge regularization performed
earlier.
9. Create neural networks for: AND, OR, NAND, NOR and NOT boolean functions.
10. Using backpropagation algorithm in neural networks, predict the values of house
prices using Boston dataset.
11. Compare performance of some classification algorithms like logistic regression
and neural networks on Iris dataset and Seeds dataset (available on UCI).
